## Electron Configuration Game

Welcome to the my Electron Configuration Game. This was a chemistry project that I did in sophomore year for the quantum mechanics unit. Feel free to fork or clone this repo.

## Explanation

The finished .exe file is included with the rest of the code. However, if you choose to make any changes, there is a shell script that can be run to rebuild the program. Make sure you have everything necessary to run the jpackage command. I will try to add comments to this in the future to make it more clear and easy to read. Thanks!
